## Encrypt AWS CloudTrail logs Cross account 
* 🤔  **Try**: I have two Accounts a master account and a sub account that is used for logging. My goal is to send the CloudTrail logs from the master account to the s3 bucket in the logging account. At this point I have configured the the CloudTrail logs to point to the s3 bucket in the logging account
* ❌ **Error**: I am getting the error `You don't have adequate permissions in S3 to perform this operation`.
* 🎯 **Solution**: Steps
  * created the customer-managed KMS on the same account + region as the s3.
  * to the KMS, added following policy
    ```
     {
       "Sid": "Allow use of the key",
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Principal": {
           "Service": "cloudtrail.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "Action": "kms:*",     # "kms:ReEncryptFrom", "kms:Decrypt" should be enough though
        "Resource": "KMS_KEY_ARN"
      }
    ```
  * enable defatul-encryption on the S3 bucket, selecting created KMS
  * in the cloudtrail (org managed account), provide the KMS with the full KMS_KEY_ARN, not just the name
